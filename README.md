# Easy Queries For Genesis

This is an example child theme for the Genesis framework. If you create an Easy Query and a page with the same slug, the posts from that Easy Query will be outputted.

Use it to create a special events page, or special post type archives (products in one of two categories).

For more information and example use cases, see: [https://calderawp.com/doc/easy-queries-for-genesis](https://calderawp.com/doc/easy-queries-for-genesis)
